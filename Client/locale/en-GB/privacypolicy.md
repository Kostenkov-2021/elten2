## The data we collect
### Log files and backup copies
Within the scope of maintenance of services related to the Elten Network portal, server event logs and backups are collected.
Event logs allow us to recreate errors and problems related to the operation of services, protect against hacking attacks and similar incidents. They do not contain any private data, in particular passwords or content sent to Elten, but only basic information about the operation of the service (protocols used, Internet browser or client version, IP address, identifier of the service they refer to).
Backups are used in the event of server failure. They contain an accurate record of the database that allows us to restore the portal in case of failure. All backups stred outside the portal's server, especially in external cloud services, are encrypted.
### User data
The only private information required by the Elten Network portal is the E-mail address. No personal information (such as name and surname) is required for registration.
Users of the Elten Network portal can fill in their profile by submitting data such as:
First name and surname, gender, birth date, place of residence.
However, these profiles are filled in voluntarily and are not collected during the registration process. Users can hide their profile from people outside their contact list and delete this information at any time.
As an additional security layer, users can activate a two-factor authentication that uses a mobile phone number to log in to the portal with the first attempt from a new device by sending a verification code via SMS. This is optional. The phone numbers collected in this way are not used for any purposes other than two-factor authentication.
